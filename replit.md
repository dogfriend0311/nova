# Nova - Space Themed Social Gaming Hub

## Overview
Nova is a space-themed social gaming hub for Roblox sports community. Members can view NABB (Roblox baseball) stats, manage profiles, watch gaming clips, and interact socially.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 (Create React App / react-scripts 5.0.1)
- **Auth/Data**: localStorage (primary) + Supabase sync layer (cross-device)
- **Supabase**: `app_data` key/value table syncs all shared data across devices; `member_profiles` table also exists
- **Styling**: CSS3 with custom neon space theme, CSS variables, animations
- **State**: React Context API (AuthContext)
- **Port**: 5000 (HOST=0.0.0.0, DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true)
- **Startup**: `src/index.jsx` loads Supabase → localStorage before React mounts; localStorage proxy auto-pushes writes to Supabase

## Project Structure
- `src/App.jsx` — Root app with state-based routing + selectedLeaguePlayer state
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` — localStorage auth, heartbeat online tracking
- `src/NABBLeague.jsx` — Full NABB league with 8 tabs: Overview, Rosters, Players, Leaders, Feed, Box Scores, Compare, Hall of Fame
- `src/LeaguePlayerPage.jsx` — Player stat card (trading card + aggregated stats)
- `src/components/admin/OwnerDashboard.jsx` — Full admin dashboard
- `src/components/pages/MemberProfile.jsx` — Discord-style own profile editor
- `src/components/pages/MemberPages.jsx` — Browse member profiles (Discord cards)
- `src/components/pages/SportsHub.jsx` — ESPN live scores/standings/news + game detail box score + player search
- `src/services/sportsDataService.js` — ESPN API: scoreboard, standings, news, game summary, athlete search/profile/stats
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx` — Real online members + live stats
- `src/components/pages/Home.jsx` — Real stats from localStorage
- `src/styles/` — globals.css, theme.css, animations.css, space.css, responsive.css
